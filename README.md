## Dependencies

- Express
- EJS
- bcrypt
- body-parser

*alternative project: - cookie-session

## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- Run the development web server using the `node express_server.js` command.


Note:  a version of the server is available which uses cookie-session instead of cookie-parser. The cookie-session version does not keep track of cookies at this time, but further work will result in the cookie-session being fully implemented.
